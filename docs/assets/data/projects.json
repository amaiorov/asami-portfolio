This approach ends up making each room quite narrow and thus a creative and unique layout is impossible to achieve. Even though a room might have a good interior, this is still not attractive for car enthusiasts who are the focus of this brand.</p>",
            "<p>The first few properties took over six months to reach full occupancy after completion of construction. This happened because the landowner's goal of a high-profit ratio conflicted with the concept to create for the car enthusiasts.</p>",
            "<p>Starting from the third property that set importance to show cars beautifully, 100% occupancy was achieved before completion of construction and remained full all the time with a waiting list for future occupancy. Therefore landowners got rent income from right after completion of construction and they did not need to spend extra money advertising to new tenants. Both contribute greatly to increasing the profit ratio of rent income. </p>",
