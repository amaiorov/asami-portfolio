However, the majority of sound-absorbing panels that are sold for professional uses look like a big kitchen sponge and are difficult to install for ordinary people; there are no beautiful designs and the ones that exist don't match the home interior.</p><p>I decided that creating sound-absorbing panels that are for ordinary people who record at home and at the same time can be considered as part of the interior was a solution for both absorbing sound and interior decorating, in addition to easy self-installation.</p>"

They were impressed by the designs and materials; additionally, this type of sound-absorbing panel design was new for them, so I was sure that we were headed in the right direction with our product.</p> <p>During the research process, we found that not only music-related people need the sound absorption panel, but we also found that there was demand for this kind of product in spaces where people gather and speak, i.e. conference rooms and restaurants. </p>"

These designs can adapt to any size of a wall by increasing or decreasing the number of elements in the pattern; they can also be used to express a unique design. Also, a new design was created by adding a variable depth to the panel, which allowed for a difference in the sound absorption effect and made the design more flexible.</p> <p>Moreover, since the sound absorption effect is enhanced by an air layer, I designed not only flat products but also three-dimensional products with an air pocket so that users can choose depending on the level of sound absorption that they need.</p>"

When renting, the tenant would be required to pay extra when they leave the apartment if they made holes in the walls. Because of this, I decided to use \"insect-pins\" for mounting the product to the wall. These make only minimum holes and the user can tap with a hammer to mount instead of drilling the wall.</p> <p>Additionally, the three-dimension version was designed to have the top panel easily removable in order to mount to the wall with pins.</p> <p>The material price was rather high, and thus efficiency of material usage was important. By having close communication with the manufacturing factory, we were able to calculate the most efficient size and arrangement when cutting from the source recycled board.</p> "
