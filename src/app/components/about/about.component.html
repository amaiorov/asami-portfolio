    <h1>Asami Tsuchiya Maiorov</h1>
    <p>Art Director and Industrial/Graphic Designer</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    I'm an art director and an industrial/graphic designer with over 15 years of experience, currently based in New York City.
  </p>
  <p>
    I worked at the furniture manufacturing company as an in-house designer for five years in Shizuoka, Japan. After I moved to Tokyo I expanded my focus from furniture design to interior design, graphic design and branding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good at not only in communication with clients but also in designing and branding own products. My strength is that I create everything from concept planning to industrial design and product advertising at once.
  </p>

  <p>
    After I moved to New York City in late 2015, I design catalogs and interior design of a new apartment for a Japanese company, and creating an E-commerce website for a company in NYC.
  </p>
  <p>
      In the future, I would like to increase opportunities for UI / UX design and digital design direction.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love Japanese history, reading books, cats. Russian beginner.
