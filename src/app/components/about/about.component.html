    <h1>Asami Tsuchiya</h1>
    <p>Product Designer</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    I started my career as a furniture designer and have been working in industrial design areas such as furniture, interiors and home goods, as well as graphic/print design for over 15 years. Halfway through my career, I expanded my design expertise to include digital product design, website and mobile app design.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love to design physical products because my work becomes a part of the user's life; at the same time designing digital products gives me new discoveries about how powerful design can be as a practical solution. I am always excited to learn new digital tools, new methods and new perspectives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below, I gathered some things about myself that I was not able to convey to you in my case studies.
