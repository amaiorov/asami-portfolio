When renting, the tenant would be required to pay extra when they leave the apartment if they made holes in the walls.

These make only minimum holes and the user can tap with a hammer to mount instead of drilling the wall.</p> <p>Additionally, the three-dimension version was designed to have the top panel easily removable in order to mount to the wall with pins.</p> <p>The material price was rather high, and thus efficiency of material usage was important.
