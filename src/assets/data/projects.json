However, the majority of sound-absorbing panels that are sold for professional uses look like a big kitchen sponge and are difficult to install for ordinary people; there are no beautiful designs and the ones that exist don't match the home interior.</p><p>I decided that creating sound-absorbing panels that are for ordinary people who record at home and at the same time can be considered as part of the interior was a solution for both absorbing sound and interior decorating, in addition to easy self-installation.</p>"

They were impressed by the designs and materials; additionally, this type of sound-absorbing panel design was new for them, so I was sure that we were headed in the right direction with our product.</p> <p>During the research process, we found that not only music-related people need the sound absorption panel, but we also found that there was demand for this kind of product in spaces where people gather and speak, i.e. conference rooms and restaurants. </p>"
