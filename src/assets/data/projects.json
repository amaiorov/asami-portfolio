Even though a room might have a good interior, this is still not attractive for car enthusiasts who are the focus of this brand.</p>",

Therefore landowners got rent income from right after completion of construction and they did not need to spend extra money advertising to new tenants. Both contribute greatly to increasing the profit ratio of rent income. </p>",
